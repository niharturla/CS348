This assignment is to be completed by individuals. 
There will be a 10% penalty if the homework is submitted 24 hours after the due date, a 20% penalty if the homework is submitted 48 hours after the due date, or a 30% penalty if the homework is submitted 72 hours after the due date. The homework will not be accepted after 72 hours, as a solution will be posted by then.

Submission Instructions: 
Submit your answers using the hw2.py skeleton file included with this assignment. The python file is read by the autograder. It is important to have a syntax-error free file. Your query result should have the same attributes(columns) exactly in the same order as the expected result shown in each question. However, the rows can be in any order unless a specific order is required by the question. Column headers can be different. Before submitting your Python file, execute the file using the command: Python3 hw2.py The output should contain all of your queries. Getting the correct output ensures that the autograder will be able to read your queries.

The homework will be submitted in Gradescope. Make sure you submit the correct file (hw2.py). The number of attempts (submissions to Gradescope) is unlimited. There is no partial in this assignment.
The Homework 2 lead TA will announce in Ed when the Gradescope submission is open. Meanwhile, you can test your queries using the database included with Homework 1. 


Notes:
- For all questions, include all columns shown in the expected result.
- You are not allowed to use the WITH clause in this homework. The autograder will return a zero score for queries that include the WITH clause.


Database instructions:
For this assignment, use medical.db SQLite database included with this assignment. You can open the database by simply typing .open medical.db in the SQLite shell. For a readable layout in SQLite shell, run the commands 
.mode column 
.headers on


The database: Use the medical.db database from Homework 1.

=============================================

12) Find the patient(s) who achieved the minimum temperature on the day(s) that include the highest tempreature across all days. For example, in the given database, 2024-01-25 has the highest temperature (100.2) across all days. The result is listing the patient with the minmum tempreature (98.5) on 2024-01-25. Note that if multiple days tie for the highest tempreature, you need to find one minimum tempreature in all of those days. 

Expected Result:

FirstName  LastName  Temperature  day
---------  --------  -----------  ----------
